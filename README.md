Script has a very intuitive interface. All you need to do to start a scan is to paste the URL link into the URL box. After that, the scan will start. Scanning may take some time, so please be patient.

Don't do too much attempts in a short perriod of time because Wayback Archive can ban your connection for some time.

When the scan is complete, you will be prompted to save the results. You can do this to check links for availability using httprobe and other tools.
The “interesting results” will sort links and files that may contain potentially sensitive information.
You can download the file of interest from this column if you need to.
